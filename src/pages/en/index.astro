    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        After completing vocational training and a two-year language study program in French-speaking Switzerland, I finished my studies in clarinet and orchestral conducting at the Lucerne Conservatory. I also studied school and sacred music at the Lucerne Academy of Music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued my vocal studies at the Basel Academy with Derrick Olsen and at the Bern Conservatory with Margrit Konrad. I also took master classes, notably with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, which helped me greatly in my vocal work and teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gained my orchestral experience as a member of the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra, which soon led me to Zurich to study conducting with Professor Ferdinand Leitner.
